# mtg-ontology

An ontology describing Magic: The Gathering.


The aim of this ontology is to provide a formal description of cards and their abilities. It is built using [linkml](linkml.io), which automatically generates a schema representation in multiple formats (jsonschema, RDF, SQLschema, SHACL, graphQL, ...).
